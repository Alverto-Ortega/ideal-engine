    <ul>
        <li>Mr.Gates with the help of Colleague Allen, founded Microsoft in 1976.</li>
        <li>On Novemeber 20,1985 the Microsoft company introduced an operating enivornment named "Windows".</li>
        <li>In 1986, the month of March was the beggining of another achievement. Microsoft held an initial public offering of 2.5 million shares in which by the end of that year Gates had become a billionaire, at age 31!</li>
        <li>Not surprisingly, Bill Gates became the richest man on the planet at the age of 39, remaining number one on the Forbes list of the World's Richest People until 2007.</li>

        <h1>Inspiration:</h1>
    <p>This man had great ambition and a vision on making a huge impact not only in the computer world, but for the global community and made it come true with the help of his partners. Although that in itself is inspiring, what really leaves a mark is the fact that the foundation him and his wife founded is one of the largest private foundations in the world in which it aims to enhance healthcare and reduce extreme poverty worldwide!
    </p>
    <p>I admire the fact that Mr.Gates signed a pledge committing to donating at least half of his wealth over the course of his lifetime to charity.<br /> Be great, and do great for the world! Ending this tribute with a quote on his hard work to inspire others:
        <h4>"I never took a day off in my twenties. Not one. And I'm still fanatical, but now i'm a little less fanatical." Bill Gates </h4>
